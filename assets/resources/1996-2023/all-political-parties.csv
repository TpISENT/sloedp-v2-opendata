19,APC,"All Peoples Congress","All Peoples Congress (APC)","The All People's Congress (APC) is one of the two major political parties in Sierra Leone, the other being its main political rival the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP). The APC has been the main opposition party in Sierra Leone since 4 April 2018 when Julius Maada Bio of the SLPP won the 2018 presidential elections, though it maintains a majority in parliament.The APC party was founded in 1960 by a breakaway group from the Sierra Leone People's Party that vehemently opposed elections before independence and instead supported independence before elections. The APC governed the country from 1968 to 1992 and became the ruling party again in 2007 after the party presidential candidate Ernest Bai Koroma won the 2007 presidential election, he contested and also won the 2012 elections. The APC lost power on 4 April 2018, with its flagbearer Samura Kamara losing the presidential election to Bio.The APC is very popular and receives large majority support in almost all of the northern districts of Sierra Leone with strong ties to the Temne and some Limba people. The APC is also popular with significant majority in the Western Area (including Freetown).Following a heavily manipulated plebiscite in 1978, the APC became the sole legal party in the country, a status it retained until 1991. Presidents Siaka Stevens and Joseph Saidu Momoh were members of the APC. Momoh was overthrown in a military coup in 1992, and during the civil war that followed, the party was severely weakened.In the parliamentary election held on 14 May 2002, the party won 19.8% of the popular vote and 22 out of 112 seats. Its candidate in the presidential elections, Ernest Bai Koroma, won 22.3% of the vote; he was defeated by Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP).For several years Koroma's leadership was challenged by some in the party, who took the issue to court; the dispute was said to be resolved in April 2007, with Koroma accepted by party dissidents as the party's leader ahead of the 2007 election. He was the party's candidate for president in the election, with the first round held in August 2007. In the first round he took first place with 44.3% of the vote, ahead of Solomon Berewa of the ruling Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) with 38.3%, but Koroma did not receive enough votes to win outright, and a second round was necessary. In the parliamentary election, held concurrently with the presidential first round, the APC won 59 out of 112 seats and became the largest party in Parliament.Koroma was victorious in the second round of the 2007 presidential election, held on 8 September, winning 54.6% of the vote against 45.4% for Berewa. He was sworn in as President on 17 September.APC has traditionally been based among the Temne and Limba people in the northSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_People%27s_Congress",1960-03-20,apc,"Siaka Stevens",/sites/default/files/party-logos/apc-party.jpg,,FF333C

It is built on the hopes and dreams of a properly functional Sierra Leone that will have sustainable development plans and national prosperity.We believe that we have a group of level-headed Sierra Leoneans from all disciplines of life who are well-intentioned that want to bring about transparent government, better fiscal policies, education and training for our citizens and a respected justice system, among other things.We believe that we can bring together a coalition of existing parties to put our aims into effect.At present we have global executives and country-specific executives whose job it has been to create relevant legal entities from which the movement can operate.We have groups of people dealing with specific tasks which makes us agile enough to deal with anything that we have been able to foresee.This movement is open to ALL Sierra Leoneans, and we welcome all your comments, questions and suggestions as we formulate and crystallize our plans.",,c4c,,/sites/default/files/party-logos/c4c-logo.jpeg,https://c4csalone.org,d68910

The purpose was to put forth a formidable challenge against the two “bigger political parties”, namely, the Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP) and the All People’s Congress (APC). Both parties had ruled Sierra Leone respectively since independence in 1961 but failed to deliver quality leadership to Sierra Leone. NADP was determined to usher in a new breed of younger and more vibrant political leaders to help reshape the political destiny of Sierra Leone.NADP founders created the party with a vision to rebuilding Sierra Leone on the foundation of exemplary leadership. The party committed to helping build a strong economy, offer opportunities for quality education, create jobs for Sierra Leoneans, secure quality health care for all, help fight global terrorism, unite the nation and make tribalism a thing of the past.In 2006, the party chose a divine motto as the foundation upon which NADP would unshackle Sierra Leone from the grips of tribalism, corruption, human right abuses and inept leadership. The motto was: “With God, All Things Are Possible”.",1995-06-01,nadp,"Mohamed Yahya Sillah, Sulaiman Sandy, Ousmann Hassann, Wurie Kaisamba, Patrick Luseni Moriba, Abdul Kamara",/sites/default/files/party-logos/default-party-symbol.jpg,,cccccc

22,NGC,"National Grand Coalition","National Grand Coalition (NGC)","The National Grand Coalition Party (NGC) is conscious of the economic, social and political challenges facing Sierra Leone, particularly the worsening conditions of poverty, social deprivation and inequality among the population. We are aware of the importance of strengthening our democratic values and practice and the need for a very enlightened and committed leadership in the entire State of Sierra Leone which, despite its smallness in area and population and its abundant resources, can hardly guarantee today the social and economic justice required for the advancement of its people. We have witnessed over the years the exploitation of the nation’s natural and human resources which has not had much impact on the quality of life of the population. The NGC, therefore, commits itself to the goal of restoring the lost glories of Sierra Leone so that she can once more take her rightful place in the international community of nations. In order to accomplish this task, the NGC shall draw inspiration from and base the entirety of our action on Sierra Leone’s foundational principles of unity, freedom and justice; the unity of a nation that harnesses its diversity for the common good, freedom for our people to enjoy their rights and live good lives as decent citizens and a system of justice that protects all citizens against unfair, unequal and harmful treatment. The NGC will endeavour to give entrepreneurship the importance it deserves so as to shift the mindset of the people away from patronage and dependency on government for jobs to inter-dependency and reliance on their own strength, talents and creativity.",,ngc,,/sites/default/files/party-logos/ngc-party-logo.jpeg,,4b0082

26,PMDC,"Peoples Movement for Democratic Change","Peoples Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC)","The People's Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC) is a socially liberal party in  Sierra Leone. It is a breakaway faction of the Sierra Leone People Party(SLPP). It was officially registered on 19 January 2006. The party is led by Charles Margai, the son of Sierra Leone's second prime minister Sir Albert Margai and the nephew of  Sir Milton Margai. The PMDC is based in the country's second largest city of Bo.Margai, as the PMDC's candidate in August 2007 Presidential Election, received third place, behind Ernest Bai Koroma  of the opposition All Peoples Congress(APC) and Solomon Berewa  of the SLPP. On August 19, Margai stated his support for Koroma in the second round of the election. On August 20, the PMDC's Karamoh Kabba explained what he said was the reasoning behind the decision: the PMDC sought to ""ensure a more representative government, the survival of the PMDC as a political party and the creation of a third formidable political force for smooth running of democracy in Sierra Leone"". Furthermore, backing the APC would help to bridge the regional political divide marking Sierra Leone's politics (the SLPP and PMDC draw their main support from the south, while the APC draws its main support from the north), while backing the SLPP would deepen it. He added that the APC had a natural reason to want the PMDC to survive, while the SLPP had a natural reason to want to destroy it.Margai's support for the APC provoked controversy in the PMDC, with some feeling that his decision was made without properly consulting the party. Margai said on August 24 that the PMDC would campaign together with the APC for the second round.At the parliamentary election that was held on the same day as the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, the PMDC became the third largest party in Parliament with 10 seats (out of 112). In the 2008 Local Government elections, the PMDC did less well, winning only one Council Chairperson seat (out of 19), and 4% of the council seats. All seats won by the party were in the Southern region, specifically in the Bo, Bonthe, Moyamba and Pujehun districts.In the 2012 elections the party lost all of its remaining seats.",2006-01-19,pmdc,"Charles Margai",/sites/default/files/party-logos/pmdc-party.jpg,,f3881e

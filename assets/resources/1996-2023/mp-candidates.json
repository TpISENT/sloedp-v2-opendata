Banker and Bilingual Specialist with a Higher Diploma in Office Studies from the College of Business Studies in France. She had worked in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in France and served as bi-lingual Secretary at the Sierra Leone Embassy in France. As a Bilingual Secretary, Honourable Tong nursed a passion for politics. With the call of her people, she decided to take on one of her toughest challenges by standing as an independent candidate to compete for the Member of Parliament role in her constituency. Amidst all the challenges from her male competitors, intimidation, and financial hurdles, she was able to stand the test of time. She won the parliamentary seat to represent her people in the Sierra Leone House of Parliament in March 2018.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHer distinguished fortitude and passion for Accountability, Health, Transportation, and Water issues affecting women and children have made her a strong advocate for women\u2019s empowerment through effective resource management, stronger and beneficial international relationship cultivation, and better employment opportunities for the people of Sierra Leone.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe above focus and passion did not go unnoticed as Honourable Tongi established herself as a strong advocate for the abovementioned issues. She is, therefore, among the very few women Members of Parliament to serve as Deputy Chairperson for Water Resources Committee. In addition, she is also a member of three other Committees: the Public Account, Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and Labour and Social Security Committees.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHonourable Tongi has identified health- especially for pregnant women, safe drinking water, and transportation as major constituency needs for her people. Therefore, she is working to ensure better legislation and oversight for effective service delivery to her people to the people of Sierra Leone.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","CandidatePhoto":"\/sites\/default\/files\/2023-04\/Hon_Emilia_Lolloh_Tongi_Const_001.jpg","CandidateSLEOP_UUID":"660cd283-2b3d-4fc3-8e37-7c07cbc44ff1","CandidateFullname":"Emilia Lolloh Tongi","ElectionDistrict":"Kailahun","ElectionCityCouncil":"","ElectionLocality":"","ElectionConstituency":"Constituency 1","ElectionWard":"","CandidateContact":"+232 77920845","CandidateEducation":"Higher Diploma in Office Studies ","CandidateEmail":"lolloh.tongi@parliament.gov.sl","CandidateGender":"Female","CandidateSkills":"","CandidateWebsite":"\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.parliament.gov.sl\/member-detail-Hon.-Emilia-Lolloh-Tongi-1.html\u0022\u003EHon.
